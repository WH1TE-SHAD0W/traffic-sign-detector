# Traffic Sign Detector

A reproducible computer-vision project for detecting and classifying traffic signs (bounding boxes + class labels). The repository will include dataset preparation, training and evaluation scripts, and **(maybe)** a small demo for running inference on uploaded images.

## Dataset

This project uses the **[GTSRB](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_dataset.html) (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)** for training.
